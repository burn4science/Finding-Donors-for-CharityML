In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - when a decision has to be made according to some consecutive or parallel questions, e.g. shall a company invest in a new building - but not only based on 1 decision tree, but on aggregation of several of them (e.g. Random Forests)\n",
    "  - [Example: Land cover mapping on satellite images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning#Land_cover_mapping)\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "  - combine several base models in an ensemble that is stronger and more robust than each individual model\n",
    "  - easy to use\n",
    "  - can handle large number of data\n",
    "  - reduce bias and/or variance, and thus overfitting\n",
    "- Weaknesses:\n",
    "  - computationally expensive\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods are a good candidate here (for instance Random Forests), because we can ask several questions and form decisions based on different answers. By randomly varying the features used to build the single decision trees in the ensemble and aggregating everything in the end, we can form a strong predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SVM**\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - A non-linear classifier is learned to separate two classes from each other in a way, that the distances of the closest points to each other are maximized. \n",
    "  - [Example: Text categorization, image classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine#Applications)\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "  - efficient\n",
    "  - can cope with high-dimensional data\n",
    "- Weaknesses:\n",
    "  - can (in the standard way) only cope with two classes (but can be enhanced towards multi-class SVMs)\n",
    "  - parameters can be hard to interpret\n",
    "- SVM can be a good candidate here because we have only 2 categories (<=50K & >50K), and high-dimensional data (103 features after one-hot-encoding). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption, that the features are mutually independent, which simplifies calculation of probabilities during training\n",
    "  - [Example: Person classification based on some measured features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Examples)\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "  - simple\n",
    "  - can achieve high accuracy levels\n",
    "  - can cope with high-dimensional data\n",
    "- Weaknesses:\n",
    "  - \"independence of the features\" is only an assumption or simplification, but might be wrong in certain applications\n",
    "- Naive Bayes can be a good candidate here, too, because it can handle high-dimensional data efficiently and is easy to understand. Apart from that: I'm simply curious to see how it will perform here. 😊"

    "When looking at the plots I would either choose the RandomForestClassifier (RFC), or the SVM Classifier (SVC). Both have a very similar F-score on the testing set @ 100% usage of training set (RFC: 0.681, SVC: 0.685), and the scores are higher than that of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier (0.421).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to choose between RFC and SVC one can look at the training and testing times. Here you can see that the SVC takes way more time to train (83s) than the RFC (4.34s), and also inference time is a lot longer.\n",

    "A Random Forest Classifier (RFC) can be imagined as an ensemble of several individual classifiers, like a forest consists of several individual trees. The trees here are called \"decision trees\" and are based on a random subset of data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree has a root and several nodes / branches. Each internal node of the tree corresponds to an attribute that is extracted from the dataset. At each node the tree asks simple \"yes\" or \"no\" questions and branches out further. Finally, after reaching a certain depth (= a certain amount of branches) each leaf node corresponds to a final class label that we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree is created during the (offline) training phase and might take a while to create. Once created, an unknown data sample can be processed (online) through the tree and when it arrives at a leaf node the corresponding class is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "An RFC repeats this process several times, by creating several trees, but for each tree the random training samples and splitting criteria for the tree nodes are shuffled and randomized. This shall offer a greatest possible variety in the training data. In the end it gathers the results from all trees and averages them to get the final prediction."

    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capital-gain**: the more money you have, the more money you will make. Unfortunately, you can't get rich by working more. Instead, when the money works for you, your chances are way higher! \n",
    "2. **Occupation**: different jobs are paid differently. So what you do affects your income.\n",
    "3. **Education**: the higher the educational level, the higher the potential income.\n",
    "4. **Race:** unfortunately, some races are discriminated against others, which is why they have it a lot harder to get the same jobs. Or other way round: belonging to certain races will increase your chances of getting higher income.\n",
    "5. **Sex**: unfortunately, the same holds for sex. Men earn more money than women, even if doing the same jobs."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
